All of the needed information is in the Project4Report. It includes the build instructions, perceptron and logistic classifier graphs with their corresponding reports. 

The files in this folder: Report, Excel that was used to create the graphs, and the output that the classifiers produced, and the src folder in which the code is in.

*NOTE*
The src folder is all the code without the specific packages so that you can run it through the terminal. It also contains the datasets. 

Thank you so much!
Samuel Frank
